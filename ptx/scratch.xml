        The Sage Notebook has its own interface and worksheet list.
        To use the sorting features optimally, it helps to have subdivisions
        begin with the same short prefix.  An "initialism" (nee acronym)
        here will be used for that purpose if present.  This is only employed
        for producing Sage notebook versions and in the title shown in the
        browser. (If not present, you will get a harmless warning just for
        Sage worksheet production.)

        With a <feedback> element, in the HTML version, you get a button

        spreadsheet or something similar.  Default is to get a button
        labeled "Feedback", which will be localized to your target language.
        You can override this with some text of your choosing, but then you
        lose the localization feature.

        "Names" for various parts of a document are determined exactly

        decide we have no need for any "proposition"s and repurpose
        that environment in US English as a "Conundrum."

        See the localization file for more on language codes, and realize
