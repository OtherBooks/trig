<p>Chad is hiking along a straight path but needs to detour around a large pond. He turns \(23\degree\) from his path until clear of the pond, then walks back to his original path, intercepting it at an angle of \(29\degree\) and at a distance of 2 miles from where he had left the path. How far did Chad walk in each of the two segments of his detour, and how much farther did his detour require compared with a straight line through the pond?</p>
