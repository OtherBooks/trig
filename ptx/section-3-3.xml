<title>The Law of Cosines</title><introduction>
<p>
If we know two angles and one side of a triangle, we can use the Law of Sines to solve the triangle. We can also use the Law of Sines when we know two sides and the angle opposite one of them.  But the Law of Sines is not helpful for the problem that opened this chapter, finding the distance from Avery to Clio.  In this case we know two sides of the triangle, <m>a</m> and <m>c</m>, and the <em>included</em> angle, <m>B</m>.</p> 

<sidebyside width="100%"><image source="images/3-3intro.png"><description>triangles</description></image></sidebyside> 

<p>To solve a triangle when we know two sides and the included angle, we will need a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem known as the Law of Cosines.</p>
<p>In a right triangle, with <m>C = 90\degree</m>, the Pythagorean theorem tells us that
<me>c^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2}</me>
If we allow angle <m>C</m> to vary, but keep <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> the same length, the side <m>c</m> will grow or shrink, depending on whether we increase or decrease the angle <m>C</m>, as shown below.  </p>

<sidebyside width="80%"><image source="images/3-3cosinelaw.png"><description>triangles</description></image></sidebyside>

<p> The Pythagorean theorem is actually a special case of a more general law that applies to all triangles, no matter what the size of angle <m>C</m>. The equation relating the three sides of a triangle is 
<me>c^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2} - 2ab \cos C</me>
You can see that when <m>C</m> is a right angle, <m>\cos 90\degree = 0</m>, so the equation reduces to the Pythagorean theorem.</p>
 <p>We can write similar equations involving the angles or <m>A</m> or <m>B</m>. The three equations are all versions of the Law of Cosines.</p>

<subsection><title>Finding a Side</title>
<sidebyside widths="50% 45%" valigns="middle middle"><p>Now we can solve the problem of the distance from Avery to Clio. Here is the figure from Section 3.1 showing the location of the three towns.</p><image source="images/3-1-towns.png"><description>triangle</description></image></sidebyside>

<example><statement><p>How far is it from Avery to Clio?</p> </statement>

<solution><sidebyside widths="50% 40%"><p>The angle <m>\angle ABC = 35\degree + 90\degree = 125\degree</m>. Thus, in <m>\triangle ABC</m> we have <m>a = 34,~ c = 48</m> and <m>B = 125\degree</m>. The distance from Avery to Clio is represented by <m>b</m> in the figure.</p> <image source="images/exam3-3-1.png"><description>triangle</description></image></sidebyside> 
    <p>We know two sides and the included angle, and we choose the version of the Law of Cosines that uses our known angle, <m>B</m>.
    \begin{align*}
                b^{2} \amp = a^{2} + c^{2} - 2ac \cos B \amp\amp \text{Substitute the known values.}\\
                b^{2} \amp = 34^{2} + 48^{2} - 2(34)(48) \cos 125\degree \amp\amp \text{Simplify the right side.}\\
                b^{2} \amp = 3460 - 3264 \cos 125\degree = 5332.153 \amp\amp \text{Take square roots.} \\
                b \amp = 73.02 \\
                \end{align*} 
    Avery is about 73 miles from Clio.</p></solution></example>

<warning><p>When simplifying the Law of Cosines, be careful to follow the order of operations.  In the previous example, the right side of the equation
<me> b^{2} = 34^{2} + 48^{2} - 2(34)(48) \cos 125\degree</me>
 has three terms, and simplifies to 
 \begin{align*} 
    b^{2} \amp = 1156 + 2304 - 3264 \cos 125\degree\\
    b^{2} \amp = 3460 - 3264(-0.573567364 ...) \\
    \end{align*}
 Note that 3264 is the coefficient of <m>\cos 125\degree</m>, so it would be incorrect to subtract 3264 from 3460. If you are using a graphing calculator, you can enter the right side of the equation exactly as it is written.</p></warning>

</statement></exercise>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Finding an Angle</title>
<p>We can also use the Law of Cosines to find an angle when we know all three sides of a triangle. Pay close attention to the algebraic steps used to solve the equation in the next example.</p>

<example><statement>
    <sidebyside widths="55% 30%"><p>In the triangle at right, <m>a = 6,~ b = 7</m>, and <m>c = 11</m>. Find angle <m>C</m>.</p>
 <image source="images/exam3-3-2.png"><description>triangle</description></image></sidebyside></statement>
<solution><p>We choose the version of the Law of Cosines that uses angle <m>C</m>.
        \begin{align*}
                c^{2} \amp = a^{2} + b^{2} - 2ab \cos C \amp\amp \text{Substitute the known values.}\\
                11^{2} \amp = 6^{2} + 7^{2} - 2(6)(7) \cos C \amp\amp \text{Simplify each side.}\\
                121 \amp = 36 + 49 - 84 \cos C \amp\amp \text{Isolate the cosine term.}\\
                36 \amp = -84 \cos C \amp\amp \text{Solve for cos C.}\\
                \dfrac{-3}{7} \amp = \cos C \amp\amp \text{Solve for C.}\\
                C \amp = \cos^{-1} (\dfrac{-3}{7}) = 115.4\degree \\
                \end{align*}
    Angle <m>C</m> is about <m>115.4\degree</m>.</p></solution></example>

<exercise><statement>
    <p>In <m>\triangle ABC</m>, <m>a = 5.3,~b = 4.7</m>, and <m>c = 6.1</m>. Find angle <m>B</m>, and round your answer to two decimal places.</p> 
</statement></exercise>

<p>Once we have calculated one of the angles in a triangle, we can use either the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines to find a second angle. Here is how we would use the Law of Sines to find angle <m>A</m> in the previous example.</p>
        <p>\begin{align*}
                \dfrac{\sin A}{a} \amp = \dfrac{\sin C}{c} \amp\amp \text{Substitute the known values.}\\
                \dfrac{\sin A}{6} \amp = \dfrac{\sin 115.4\degree}{11} \amp\amp \text{Solve for} \sin A.\\
               \sin A \amp = 6 \cdot \dfrac{\sin 115.4\degree}{11} \approx 0.4928 \\
                \end{align*}</p>
<p>Thus, <m>A = \sin^{-1}(0.4928) = 29.5\degree</m>. (We know that <m>A</m> is an acute angle because it is opposite the shortest side of the triangle.)  Finally,
<me>B = 180\degree - (A + C) \approx 35.1\degree</me>
Alternatively, we can use the Law of Cosines to find angle <m>A</m>.
        \begin{align*}
                a^{2} \amp = b^{2} + c^{2} - 2bc \cos A \amp\amp \text{Substitute the known values.}\\
                6^{2} \amp = 7^{2} + 11^{2} - 2(7)(11) \cos A \amp\amp \text{Simplify each side.}\\
                36 \amp = 49 + 121 - 154 \cos A \amp\amp \text{Isolate the cosine term.}\\
                -134 \amp = -154 \cos A \amp\amp \text{Solve for} \cos A.\\
                \dfrac{67}{77} \amp = \cos A \amp\amp \text{Solve for A.}\\
                A \amp = \cos^{-1} (\dfrac{67}{77}) = 29.5\degree \\
                \end{align*}</p>

<note><p>Using the Law of Sines requires fewer calculations than the Law of Cosines, but the Law of Cosines uses only the original values, instead of the results of our previous calculations and approximations.</p><p> Whenever we round off a number, we introduce inaccuracy into the calculations, and these inaccuracies grow with each additional calculation. Thus, for the sake of accuracy, it is best to use given values in preference to calculated values whenever possible.</p></note>

<subsection><title>Using the Law of Cosines for the Ambiguous Case</title>
<p>In Section 3.2 we encountered the ambiguous case:</p>  <p>If we know two sides <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> of a triangle and the acute angle <m>\alpha</m> opposite one of them, there may be one solution, two solutions, or no solution, depending on the size of <m>a</m> in relation to <m>b</m> and <m>\alpha</m>, as shown below.</p>

<assemblage>
<p><ol label="1" cols="2">
    <li>No solution: <m>a \lt b \sin \alpha</m>
        <sidebyside width="35%"><image source="images/3-3amcase1.png"><description>triangle</description></image></sidebyside>
        <m>\alpha</m> is too short to make a triangle.</li>
     <li>One solution: <m>a = b \sin \alpha</m> 
        <sidebyside width="35%"><image source="images/3-3amcase2.png"><description>triangle</description></image></sidebyside>
         <m>\alpha</m> is exactly the right length to make a right triangle</li>
      <li>Two solutions:  <m>b \sin \alpha \lt a \lt b</m>   
        <sidebyside width="35%"><image source="images/3-3amcase3.png"><description>triangle</description></image></sidebyside></li>
      <li>One solution: <m>a \gt b</m>  
        <sidebyside width="70%"><image source="images/3-3amcase4.png"><description>triangle</description></image></sidebyside></li>
</ol></p>
</assemblage>

<p>If <m>\alpha</m> is an obtuse angle, things are simpler: there is one solution if <m>a \gt b</m>, and no solution if <m>a \le b</m>.</p>

<p>Because there are always two angles with a given sine, if we use the Law of Sines for the ambiguous case, we must check whether both possible angles result in a triangle. But here is another approach: We can apply the Law of Cosines to find the third side first. With that method, we'll need the quadratic formula.</p>

<assemblage><title>Quadratic Formula</title>
<p>The solutions of the quadratic equation <m>ax^{2} + bx + c = 0,~~a \not= 0,</m> are given by
<me>x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}</me>
</p></assemblage>

<p>A quadratic equation can have one solution, two solutions, or no solution, depending on the value of the <term>discriminant</term>, <m>b^{2} - 4ac</m>. If we use the Law of Cosines to find a side in the ambiguous case, the quadratic formula will tell us how many triangles have the given properties.</p> 
<p><ul>
    <li>If the quadratic equation has one positive solutions, there is one triangle.</li>
    <li>If the quadratic equation has two positive solutions, there are two triangles.</li>
    <li> If the quadratic equation has no positive solutions, there is no triangle with the given properties.</li>
</ul></p>

<example><statement>
    <p>In <m>\triangle ABC,~ B = 14.4\degree,~ a = 8</m>, and <m>b = 3</m>. Solve the triangle.</p></statement>
<solution><p>We begin by finding the third side of the triangle.  Using the Law of Cosines, we have</p>
        <p>\begin{align*}
                b^{2} \amp = a^{2} + c^{2} - 2ac \cos B \amp\amp \text{Substitute the known values.}\\
                3^{2} \amp = 8^{2} + c^{2} - 2(8)c \cos 14.4\degree \amp\amp \text{Simplify.}\\
                9 \amp = 64 + c^{2} - 16c (0.9686)  \amp\amp \text{Write the quadratic equation in standard form.} \\
                0 \amp = c^{2}-15.497c + 55 \amp\amp \text{Apply the quadratic formula.}\\
                \end{align*} </p>
         
         <p>\begin{align*}
            c \amp = \dfrac{15.497 \pm \sqrt{(-15.497)^{2} - 4(1)(55)}}{2(1)} \amp\amp \text{Simplify.}\\
              \amp = \dfrac{15.497 \pm  4.490}{2} = 5.503~ \text{or}~ 9.994\\
              \end{align*}</p>     
        <p>Because there are two positive solutions for side <m>c</m>, either <m>c = 5.503</m> or <m>c = 9.994</m>, there are two triangles with the given properties.  We apply the Law of Cosines again to find angle <m>C</m> in each triangle.</p>  
        <p>For the triangle with <m>c = 5.503</m>, we have</p>
            <p> \begin{align*}
                c^{2} \amp = a^{2} + b^{2} - 2ab \cos C \amp\amp \text{Substitute the known values.}\\
                5.503^{2} \amp = 8^{2} + 3^{2} - 2(8)(3) \cos C \amp\amp \text{Solve for} \cos C.\\
                \cos C \amp = \dfrac{5.503^{2} - 64 - 9}{-48} = 0.889876\\
                C \amp = \cos^{-1} 0.889876) = 27.1\degree \\
                \end{align*}</p>
           <p>and <m>A = 180\degree - (14.4\degree + 27.1\degree) = 138.5\degree</m>.</p>
           <p>  For the triangle with <m>c = 9.994</m>, we have</p>
           <p> \begin{align*}
                c^{2} \amp = a^{2} + b^{2} - 2ab \cos C \amp\amp \text{Substitute the known values.}\\
                9.994^{2} \amp = 8^{2} + 3^{2} - 2(8)(3) \cos C \amp\amp \text{Solve for} \cos C.\\
                \cos C \amp = \dfrac{9.994^{2} - 64 - 9}{-48} = -0.560027\\
                C \amp = \cos^{-1} (-0.560027) = 124.1\degree \\
                \end{align*}</p>
         <p>and <m>A = 180\degree - (14.4\degree + 124.1\degree) = 41.5\degree</m>.  Both triangles are shown below.</p>
         <sidebyside width="90%"><image source="images/exam3-3-3.png"><description>triangle</description></image></sidebyside></solution></example>

<note><p>In the previous example, notice that we used the Law of Cosines instead of the Law of Sines to find a second angle in the triangle, because there is only one angle between <m>0\degree</m> and <m>180\degree</m> with a given cosine. We don't have to check the results, as we would if we used the Law of Sines.</p></note>

<subsection><title>Navigation</title>
<p>Even with the aid of GPS (Global Positioning System) instruments, aircraft pilots and ship captains need to understand navigation based on trigonometry.</p>

 <example><statement><p>The sailing club leaves the marina on a heading <m>15\degree</m> east of north and sails for 18 miles. They then change course, and after traveling for 12 miles on a heading <m>35\degree</m> east of north, they experience engine trouble and radio for help. The marina sends a speed boat to rescue them. How far should the speed boat go, and on what heading?</p></statement>
<solution><sidebyside widths="50% 30%"><p>We'd like to find the distance <m>x</m> and the angle <m>\theta</m> shown in the figure. In <m>\triangle ABC</m>, we can calculate the angle at point <m>B</m> where the sailing club changed course: 
<me>B = 180\degree - 35\degree+ 15\degree = 160\degree</me>
We know <m>a = 12</m> and <m>c = 18</m>.  We use the Law of Cosines to find <m>b</m> and <m>\angle A</m>.</p><image source="images/exam3-3-4.png"><description>triangles</description></image></sidebyside>
        <p>\begin{align*}
                b^{2} \amp = a^{2} + c^{2} - 2ac \cos B \amp\amp \text{Substitute the known values.}\\
                 \amp = 12^{2} + 18^{2} - 2(12)18 \cos 160\degree = 873.95\amp\amp \text{Take square roots.}\\
                b \amp = 29.56 \\
                \end{align*} </p>
<p>Next, we apply the Law of Cosines again to find <m>\angle A</m>.</p>  
         <p> \begin{align*}
                a^{2} \amp = b^{2} + c^{2} - 2bc \cos A \amp\amp \text{Substitute the known values.}\\
                12^{2} \amp = 29.56^{2} + 18^{2} - 2(29.56)(18) \cos A \amp\amp \text{Solve for} \cos A.\\
                \cos A \amp = \dfrac{12^{2} - 29.56^{2} - 18^{2}}{-2(29.56)(18)} = 0.9903\\
                C \amp = \cos^{-1} (0.9903) = 8\degree \\
                \end{align*}</p> 
 <p>Thus, <m>x = 29.56</m> and <m>\theta = 8\degree + 15\degree = 23\degree</m>. The speed boat should travel 29.56 miles on a heading <m>23\degree</m> east of north.</p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>Applications</title>
<p> In the next example, we use two triangles to solve the problem.</p>

<example><statement>
    <p>Richard wants to measure the height of a castle controlled by hostile forces. When he is as close as he can get to the castle, the angle of elevation to the top of the wall is <m>18.5\degree</m>. He then retreats 20 yards and measures the angle of elevation again; this time it is <m>15.9\degree</m>. How tall is the castle?</p>
<sidebyside width="80%"><image source="images/exam3-2-5.png"><description>castle</description></image></sidebyside></statement>

<solution><p>Notice that <m>h</m> is one side of the right triangle <m>ADC</m>. If we can find its hypotenuse, labeled <m>r</m> in the figure, we can use the sine ratio to find <m>h</m>. To find <m>r</m>, we consider a second triangle, <m>ABC</m>, as shown below.</p>
<sidebyside width="60%"><image source="images/exam3-2-5soln.png"><description>castle</description></image></sidebyside>
<p>In this triangle, we know side <m>BC = 20</m> and would like to find side <m>AC = r</m>.  We can use the Law of Sines to find <m>r</m>, but first we must calculate the other angles of the triangle.</p>
<p>Now, the angle opposite <m>r, ~\angle ABC</m>, is the complement of <m>18.5\degree</m>, so
<me>\angle ABC = 180\degree - 18.5\degree = 161.5\degree</me>
The angle opposite the 20-yard side, <m>\angle BAC</m>, is
<me>\angle BAC = 180\degree - (161.5\degree + 15.9\degree) = 2.6\degree</me>
Now we can apply the Law of Sines to find <m>r</m>. We have</p>
        <p>\begin{align*}
                \dfrac{r}{\sin 161.5\degree} \amp = \dfrac{20}{\sin 2.6\degree} \amp\amp \text{Solve for }r.\\
               r \amp = \sin 161.5\degree \cdot \dfrac{20}{\sin 2.6\degree} \approx 139.9 \\
                \end{align*}</p>
         <p>So <m>r</m> is about 139.9 yards.  Finally, using the right triangle <m>ADC</m> and the definition of sine, we can write</p>  
         <p>\begin{align*}
                \dfrac{h}{r} \amp = \sin 15.9\degree \amp\amp \text{Solve for }h.\\
               h \amp = r \cdot \sin 15.9\degree \approx 38.33 \\
                \end{align*}</p>
      <p>The castle is about 38.33 yards tall.</p></solution></example>

    <p>Solve the problem in the previous example again, but instead of finding <m>r</m>, find the length <m>AB</m>, and then use <m>\triangle ABD</m>  to find <m>h</m>.</p>

<subsection><title>Measuring Astronomical Distances</title>      
<p> If you look at a nearby object and alternately close your left and right eyes, the object seems to jump in position. This apparent change occurs because your eyes are viewing the object from two different positions spaced several centimeters apart. If the object at point <m>O</m> is straight ahead of one eye, it appears to be at some angle <m>p</m> away from the line of sight of the other eye. The angle <m>p</m> is called the <term>parallax</term> of the object.</p>
<p> Use the figure below to see that <m>p</m> is also the angle between the directions to your two eyes when viewed from point <m>O</m>.  (What fact from geometry justifies this statement?)</p>

<solution><p>We let <m>x</m> represent the distance to the asteroid.  The asteroid and the two observers make an isosceles triangle with base 1000 km and equal sides of length <m>x</m>, as shown below.</p>
<sidebyside width="50%"><image source="images/exam3-2-6.png"><description>castle</description></image></sidebyside>
<p>The base angles of the triangle are both <m>\dfrac{180\degree - 0.001\degree}{2} = 89.999\degree</m>. By the Law of Sines,</p>
<p>\begin{align*}
                \dfrac{x}{\sin 89.999\degree} \amp = \dfrac{1000}{\sin 0.001\degree} \amp\amp \text{Solve for }x.\\
               x \amp = \sin 89.999\degree \cdot \dfrac{1000}{\sin 0.001\degree}  \\
               x \amp \approx 57,000,000\\
                \end{align*}</p>
  <p>The asteroid is about 57 million kilometers from Earth (roughly one third of the distance to the Sun).</p></solution></example>              

<exercise><statement>
    <p>Two observers 800 kilometers apart observe an object with a parallax of <m>0.0005\degree</m>. How far is the object from Earth?</p> 
</statement></exercise>

<subsection><title>Small Angles: Minutes and Seconds</title>
<p>To obtain the most accurate parallax measurements, the distance between the two observers should be as large as possible. But even measured from opposite sides of Earth's orbit, stars outside the solar system have parallaxes much smaller than <m>0.0001\degree</m>.</p>
<p> In order to handle such small angles, we divide degrees into smaller units called <term>minutes</term> and <term>seconds</term>.  One minute is <m>\dfrac{1}{60}</m> of a degree, and 1 second is <m>\dfrac{1}{60}</m> of a minute, or <m>\dfrac{1}{3600}</m> of a degree.  We use the following notation for minutes and seconds.</p>

<assemblage><title>Fractions of a Degree</title>
<p><ul>
    <li>One minute:    <m>~~~~~~1^{\prime} = \dfrac{1\degree}{60}</m></li>
    <li>One second:    <m>~~~~~~1^{\prime \prime} = \dfrac{1^{\prime}}{60} = \dfrac{1\degree}{3600}</m></li>
</ul></p>         
</assemblage>

<p> When describing large distances, astronomers sometimes use the distance from Earth to the Sun, about 93 million miles, as the unit of measurement. This distance is called 1 <term>Astronomical Unit</term>, or 1 <term>AU</term>. For example, an object that is three times as far away as the Sun would be at a distance of 3 AU.</p>

<example><statement>
    <p>The star Wolf 359 has a parallax of <m>0.85^{\prime \prime}</m> when observed from opposites sides of Earth's orbit. How far away is the star?</p>
</statement>
<solution><p>In the figure below, the star Wolf 359 is located at point <m>O</m>. Our Sun is located at point <m>C</m>, halfway between the two observation points at <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.  Thus, the distance between the observation points is twice the distance from the Earth to the Sun, or 2 AU.</p>
<sidebyside width="50%"><image source="images/exam3-2-7.png"><description>triangle</description></image></sidebyside>
<p>The altitude from <m>O</m> to side <m>\overline{AB}</m> forms a right triangle <m>ACO</m> and bisects the angle at <m>O</m>. Thus   
<me>\angle AOC = \dfrac{1}{2}(0.85^{\prime \prime}) = 0.425^{\prime \prime}</me> 
We use the definition of tangent to find</p>
<p>\begin{align*}
                \tan 0.425^{\prime \prime} \amp = \dfrac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} \\
               \tan (0.425\degree / 3600) \amp = \dfrac{1}{x}  \amp\amp \text{Solve for }x.\\
               x \amp = \dfrac{1}{\tan 0.425\degree / 3600}  \approx 485,000\\
                \end{align*}</p>
  <p>The star is approximately <m>485,000</m> AU from Earth, or nearly half a million times the distance from Earth to the Sun.</p></solution></example>

<exercise><statement>
    <p>Two observers are 1 AU (astronomical unit) apart.  They find that the parallax to a distant star is <m>1^{\prime \prime}</m>.  What is the distance to the star, in astronomical units?</p>  
    <p>(This distance is called a <term>parsec</term>. In other words, a parsec is the distance at which the parallax from observations 1 AU apart is <m>1^{\prime \prime}</m>.  In this Exercise, you are calculating the number of astronomical units in 1 parsec.)</p>

<li> We can use the Law of Sines to find an unknown side in an oblique triangle. We must know the angle opposite the unknown side, and another side-angle pair.</li>
<li>We can also use the Law of Sines to find an unknown angle of a triangle. We must know two sides of the triangle and the angle opposite one of them.</li>
<li>Remember that there are two angles with a given sine. When using the Law of Sines, we must check whether both angles result in possible triangles.</li> 
<li>We use minutes and seconds to measure very small angles.
